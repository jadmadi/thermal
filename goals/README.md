# Goals Status & Pragmatic Execution Roadmap

This index tracks all goal packages under `goals/`, their execution mode (Independent ⚡ vs Dependent 🔗), dependencies, and progress status.

## 🤖 Agent Guide: How to Create, Claim & Execute Goals

1. **Create a Goal**: Scaffold a new goal package conforming to standards:
   ```bash
   sila goals create <slug> --title="..." [--depends-on="..."] [--independent]
   ```
2. **Claim a Goal**: Lock the goal so no other agent duplicates work:
   ```bash
   sila goals claim <slug> --agent=<name> [--note="evaluating..."]
   ```
3. **Launch & Implement**: Follow `facts.md` and `plan.md` until all tests pass:
   ```bash
   /goal goals/<slug>/goal.md
   ```
4. **Progress Updates**: Report status updates during execution:
   ```bash
   sila goals report <slug> "Running e2e test suite"
   ```
5. **Commit with Goal Reference**: Include the goal path in your commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(scope): implement description (goals/<slug>/goal.md)"
   ```
6. **Auto-Reconciliation**: Run `sila goals` to scan commits, mark 🟢 **Implemented**, and clear the claim lock.
